### Nice to meet you, I'm Tianhui! *(pronounced tian-hway)* ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently looking for a Fall 2021 internship. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:t225yang@uwaterloo.ca) to discuss open opportunities!

Some fun facts about me:
- recently built a mortgage application tracker at RBC
- working on a [battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) algorithm
- taking courses on Data Structures, Computer Organization & Design, Foundations of Sequential Programs (+ a few more) at the University of Waterloo
- learning to be a better plant mom - ask me about my plants! ðŸŒ±
